# User Centered Website Project 

Describe your site here.  We talk about apps as tools that allow Users to interact with data. 

In your description be sure to include: 
* Who your users are 
* Why they want to use your app
* What information they interact with
* How they can interact with the data

## User Stories


Write every interaction you'd like a user to have with your website.

Don't worry about what order you write them in, that's what the next sections in the README are for.

## Story Dependencies

Make a dependency chart for your user stories on Sketchboard.io and push it to this repository.

![](./<your chart name>.png)

This chart will organize your user stories into a [tree](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-tree-data-structures-bceacb85490c) where any child cannot be developed before it's parent.  ie. "User can save data" would be a parent of "User can retrieve data".

Doing this can be tricky at first but with practice will give you an incredibly powerful way to think about the development process.

## Development Schedule

Write a list from 0 (set up project) to N (final step).

This list is built by referring to the chart you made above.  You can put your user stories in any order as long as you respect the parent/child relationships illustrated in the tree.

To use this list correctly you can't just plow through the list.  After finishing each story, pause and test the application:  Does the new story work? Do the old ones still work?  Your goal is to add _non-breaking_ features to your site, one at a time and in a logical order.

This skills is central to the Agile methodology.  Practice it now while you're still building basic web pages, it will be hard to learn when you're in the middle of a deployment!
